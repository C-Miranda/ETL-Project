",,"<p>Regulatory Agency:</p>
<p>The Oregon Liquor Control Commission regulates the purchase, sale, production, processing, transportation and delivery of recreational cannabis in Oregon generally. Effective July 27, 2015, Senate Bill 460 (2015) directed the Oregon Health Authority to allow registered medical marijuana dispensaries the option of selling limited recreational cannabis products (dried leaves and flowers, immature marijuana plants and seeds) to persons 21 and older until December 31, 2016.</p>
<p>Cultivation Restrictions:</p>
<p>For further detail, see O.R.S. § 475B.075, OAR 845-025-2040.</p>
<p>Retail Sales:</p>
<p>Retailers licensed by the Oregon Liquor Control Commission will begin sales of cannabis as soon as applications are approved. Retail licensees may not permit on-site consumption of cannabis, except for consumption by employees with a current medical registry identification card. OAR 845-025-1230.</p>
<p>Pricing Controls Imposed:</p>
<p>No licensee or permitee may give or permit the giving of any cannabis item as a prize, premium, or consideration for any lottery, contest, game of chance or skill, exhibition, or any competition of any kind. In addition, a licensee or permitee may not sell or offer for sale any cannabis item for a price per item that is less than the licensee's cost for the cannabis item, and the pricing of cannabis items must remain consistent during each day.</p>
<p>Tax Imposed:</p>
<p>A tax of 17% upon the retail sale of cannabis was authorized effective October 5, 2015; however, this tax was not collected until sales by licensed retailers were generated. For the first three months of recreational sales by dispensaries, taxes were not imposed. After January 1, 2016, a 25% tax was collected on sales for recreational use by medical dispensaries. There is no general state sales tax in Oregon.</p>

",,"<p>Regulatory Agency:</p>
<p>When Initiative Measure 502 was passed the regulatory agency charged with regulating cannabis was called the Washington State Liquor Board. On July 24, 2014 the agency's name was changed to the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board.</p>
<p>Products Permitted:</p>
<p>“Marijuana-infused products” are defined as products that contain marijuana or marijuana extracts, are intended for human use, are derived from marijuana, as defined, and have a THC concentration no greater than ten percent. The term “marijuana-infused products” does not include either useable marijuana or marijuana concentrates. “Marijuana concentrates” means products consisting wholly or in part of the resin extracted from any part of the plant Cannabis and having a THC concentration greater than ten percent.</p>
<p>Cultivation Restrictions:</p>
<p>For further detail, see Wash. Admin. Code § 314-55-075.</p>
<p>Retail Sales:</p>
<p>The creation of a licensing system governing retail sales was mandated on December 6, 2012, by 2012 Wash. Initiative Measure No. 502. However, retail sales did not begin in Washington until July 8, 2014, according to news reports. See, e.g., Johnson, K. ""Sales of Recreational Marijuana Begin in Washington State."" The New York Times. July 8, 2014. Retrieved on 12/14/2017 from <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/09/us/washington-to-begin-sales-of-recreational-marijuana.html"">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/09/us/washington-to-begin-sales-of-recre...</a> . The state board, in consultation with the office of financial management, is required to determine the maximum number of retail outlets that may be licensed in each county. See Wash. Rev. Code § 69.50.345, Wash. Admin. Code § 314-55-081 (eff. November 21, 2013).</p>
<p>Pricing Controls Imposed:</p>
<p>Marijuana retailers may not sell marijuana products below their acquisition cost. Beginning on June 18, 2016, retailers may not provide free samples to customers.</p>
<p>Tax Imposed:</p>
<p>General sales tax (6.5 percent) applies in addition to the cannabis-specific tax. Wash. Rev. Code §§ 69.50.535, 82.08.020.</p>
<p>Local Authority:</p>
<p>The initiative that legalized the recreational use of cannabis in Washington State, Initiative 502 (I-502), neither provided for local option or control nor explicitly prohibited it. In a January 16, 2014 opinion, the Washington State Attorney General concluded that I-502 did not clearly preempt local authority to regulate cannabis businesses and did not limit the authority of local governments to regulate within their boundaries or impose land use and business licensing requirements with respect to licensed marijuana businesses. Wash. Op. Att'y Gen. 2014 No. 2 (2014).</p>

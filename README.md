With the combined data sources we will be able to: 
      a. view each state's laws regarding recreational use and each state's legal classification; 
      b. compare drug death rate between the states that legalized marijuana VS. those that havenâ€™t. 
      C.compare marijuana tax revenue among the states that have legalized marijuana

# ETL-Project

ETL Project Proposal 

Data Analysts: Anna Zhang, Carolina Miranda, & Julia Alsop 

Data Sources:

State Marijuana Laws (CSV)
	https://data.world/sya/marijuana-laws-by-state/workspace/file?filename=state_marijuana_laws_10_2016.csv

Recreational Use of Cannabis by State (CSV)

https://alcoholpolicy.niaaa.nih.gov/cannabis-policy-topics/recreational-use-of-cannabis-volume-1/104

Drug Death 
https://www.kaggle.com/andrewgatchalian/drug-deaths-economic-conditions-19992016

____________________________________________________________________________

With the combined data sources we will be able to: 
      a. view each state's laws regarding recreational use and each state's legal classification; 
      b. compare drug death rate between the states that legalized marijuana VS. those that havenâ€™t.
